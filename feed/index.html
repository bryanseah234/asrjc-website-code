										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><u>PASSION FOR LEARNING</u></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Name: Gideon Isaac Ong Gie Leong</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class: 19/24</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1973 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Gideon2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Gideon2-200x300.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Gideon2-768x1152.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Gideon2-683x1024.jpg 683w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Gideon2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Gideon has always had a passion for the sciences. A self-directed learner, he capitalised on various learning opportunities beyond the classroom, such as by signing up for talks at the National University of Singapore (NUS) to gain a deeper understanding of biology and its applications. He also embarked on a research attachment in NUS, working on brain research after taking the initiative to contact a professor he met during Brain Camp. Through the attachment, not only did he learn research techniques from his mentor, he also took the initiative to learn from other scientists on different research techniques.</p>
<p>Apart from his love for research, Gideon is interested in developing solutions to address issues related to climate change. He took part in the Spellman High Voltage Electronics Clean Tech Competition, during which his team conducted experiments to reduce reliance on air-conditioning. He also participated in other competitions like the Lee Kong Chian (LKC) Medicine Anatomy Challenge and the Ophthalmology Biomedical Quiz, the latter in which he achieved a Bronze prize.</p>
<p>Gideon performed exceptionally well in the 2019 A-Level Examinations – ‘A’s for all his 4 H2 subjects (Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Economics) as well as a coveted ‘Distinction’ for H3 Biology.  Gideon is keen to be a scientist and hopes to pursue a course in either life sciences or bio-engineering.</p>

<p><strong>Class: 19/17</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-2002 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VANESSA2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="414" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VANESSA2-200x300.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VANESSA2-768x1152.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VANESSA2-683x1024.jpg 683w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VANESSA2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" /></p>
<p>In the middle of her JC2 year in 2017, Vanessa was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma (a cancer of the bone). When the news sunk in, she was at a loss. It came as a rude shock to someone like her who was very active in the college community. At first, she thought that she could continue with school and complete her A-Levels as planned. However, this no longer became an option because of the treatment regimen she had to undergo. She took a Leave of Absence from college, and spent the next year and a half in and out of hospital. The treatment process included surgery to remove the tumour and rounds of intensive chemotherapy to eradicate the cancer cells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, Vanessa was not one to succumb to the ailment. On the contrary, she was tenacious and persevered every step of the way. She found strength from the unwavering encouragement of her friends and family throughout the recovery period. Upon returning to college, her teachers also helped support her in the transition back to school, and in preparation for the A-Levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vanessa eventually performed very commendably, obtaining 84 rank points in the 2019 A-Level Examinations.  Having benefitted from the care of the doctors and nurses throughout her time in hospital, she feels an obligation to give back in the healthcare sector, and intends to pursue a career in the sector, pursuing her particular interest in pharmacy.</p>

<p>Haripriya was a student of SRJC. She faltered in her first year and was retained, but bounced back resiliently when she repeated JC1 in Anderson Serangoon JC. She learnt from her mistakes, prioritising and making more judicious use of her time.</p>
<p>Even as she chose to focus on her studies, Haripriya was someone with deep empathy for others. Having lost a friend to depression previously, she was especially watchful over others who displayed signs of going through a hard time. She was nominated to be in the pioneer batch of Peer Support Leaders in ASRJC, a group that was dedicated to recognising signs of and responding appropriately to emotional distress. She believes in walking the difficult journey together with her vulnerable friends, and reaching out even to complete strangers among her peers to offer a listening ear. Her empathy for others also extended to her community work outside of college. She is still currently volunteering at a hospice and is tutoring young children from low-income families.</p>
<p>Despite a bout of dengue during the 2019 A-Level Examinations, Haripriya obtained a laudable 80 rank points. She hopes to pursue a course of study in Business. While a career in the social work sector might seem a more fitting choice, she feels otherwise. To her, having a distinct delineation between professional work and volunteerism helps maintain the clarity in her core mission of helping others out of her own volition.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh Jin Yuan has been living with his grandmother since his father’s passing when Jin Yuan was younger. Mature beyond his age, he often helped his grandmother cook and also tutored his sister. It was typically only after these duties that he was able to start on his own homework. To optimise the use of his time, he also leveraged time in between lessons in school to revise and do his homework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the year of his A-Level Examinations, Jin Yuan’s grandmother was hospitalised for three months after a fall. Jin Yuan had to quickly adapt to and make the best of the situation. He and his sister temporarily stayed with his uncle. During this trying period, apart from the frequent shuttling between his own house, his uncle’s house and hospital, Jin Yuan also had to help coach his sister who was sitting for the PSLE. It was difficult for him to concentrate on his studies initially as he had to juggle between his academic studies and the demands at home. Despite the difficult family circumstances he faced, he persevered and adjusted to the unexpected predicament, and learnt to manage his time to catch up on his studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the A-Levels, Jin Yuan performed very well, obtaining straight ‘A’s for his H2 subjects in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. He hopes to pursue Chemistry-related studies in the university and has aspirations of becoming a pharmacist.</p>
